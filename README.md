- code returns correct answer in IDE. Results in error in HackRank website. Issue unknown requires troubleshooting :/
- added separate branch for diagonal difference problem
- making main branch only contain public static void (String[]args) method.
- made branch for staircase problem.
- ran tests to see if Java can turn number * " " into multiple spaces which would make problem easier.
