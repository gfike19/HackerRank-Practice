# HackerRank Practice #

## 4/29/2024 ## 
- code returns correct answer in IDE. Results in error in HackRank website. Issue unknown requires troubleshooting :/
- added separate branch for diagonal difference problem
- making main branch only contain public static void (String[]args) method.
- made branch for staircase problem.
- ran tests to see if Java can turn number * " " into multiple spaces which would make problem easier.

## 5/2/2024 ##
- created branch for staircase problem.
- started work on solution.
- current code doesn't work.

## 5/3/2024 ##
- added function specifically for running stair case problem.
- added random number generator to make value to pass to function.
- tried a few things. Nothing works at present. Need remember to mark down what works and what doesn't.

## 5/5/2024 ##
= got staircase problem working but doesn't match expected output from HackerRank.
Further troubleshooting needed.
